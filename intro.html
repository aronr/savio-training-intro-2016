<h1 id="system-capabilities-and-hardware">System capabilities and hardware</h1>
<ul>
<li>Savio is a 323-node, 6696-core Linux cluster rated at 200 peak teraFLOPS.</li>
<li>162 compute nodes provided by the institution for general access</li>
<li>161 nodes contributed by researchers in the Condo program</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="getting-access-to-the-system---fca-and-condo">Getting access to the system - FCA and condo</h1>
<ul>
<li>All regular Berkeley faculty can request 200,000 service units (roughly core-hours) per year through the <a href="http://research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/faculty-computing-allowance">Faculty Computing Allowance (FCA)</a></li>
<li>Researchers can also purchase nodes for their own priority access and gain access to the shared Savio infrastructure and to the ability to <em>burst</em> to additional nodes through the <a href="http://research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/condo-cluster-program">condo cluster program</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Faculty/principle investigators can allow researchers working with them to get user accounts with access to the FCA or condo resources available to the faculty member.</p>
<h1 id="savio-computing-nodes">Savio computing nodes</h1>
<p>Let's take a look at the hardware specifications of the computing nodes on the cluster: <a href="http://research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/user-guide">(see the <em>Hardware Configuration</em> section of this document)</a>.</p>
<p>The nodes are divided into several pools, called partitions <a href="http://research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/user-guide">(see the <em>configuration details</em> section of this document)</a>. Any job you submit must be submitted to a partition to which you have access.</p>
<h1 id="disk-space-options-home-scratch-project-condo-storage">Disk space options (home, scratch, project, condo storage)</h1>
<p>You have access to the following disk space as described <a href="http://research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/user-guide">here in the <em>Storage and Backup</em> section</a>.</p>
<p>When reading/writing data to/from disk, unless the amount of data is small, please put the data in your scratch space at <code>/global/scratch/YOUR_USERNAME</code>. The system is set up so that disk access for all users is optimized when users are doing input/output (I/O) off of scratch rather than off of their home directories. Doing I/O with files on your home directory can impact the ability of others to access their files on the filesystem.</p>
<p>We are also making available disk space for purchase via a new <em>condo storage</em> offering. The minimum purchase is $7000, which will provide roughly 20-25 TB for five years.</p>
<h1 id="login-nodes-compute-nodes-and-dtn-nodes">Login nodes, compute nodes, and DTN nodes</h1>
<p>Savio has a few different kinds of nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>login nodes: for login and non-intensive interactive work such as job submission and monitoring, basic compilation, managing your disk space</li>
<li>data transfer nodes: for transferring data to/from Savio</li>
<li>compute nodes: for computational tasks</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="logging-in">Logging in</h1>
<p>To login, you need to have software on your own machine that gives you access to a UNIX terminal (command-line) session. These come built-in with Mac (see <code>Applications -&gt; Utilities -&gt; Terminal</code>). For Windows, some options include <em>Putty</em>.</p>
<p>Here are instructions for <a href="http://research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/logging-savio">logging in</a>.</p>
<p>You need to set up your smartphone or tablet with Google authenticator to generate one-time passwords for you.</p>
<p>Then to login:</p>
<pre><code>ssh YOUR_USERNAME@hpc.brc.berkeley.edu</code></pre>
<p>Then enter XXXXXYYYYYY where XXXXXX is your PIN and YYYYYY is the one-time password.</p>
<p>If you want to be able to open programs with graphical user interfaces:</p>
<pre><code>ssh -X YOUR_USERNAME@hpc.brc.berkeley.edu</code></pre>
<p>To display the graphical windows on your local machine, you'll need X server software on your own machine (which manages the graphical windows). For Windows, your options include <em>eXceed</em> or <em>Xming</em> and for Mac, there is <em>XQuartz</em>.</p>
<h1 id="data-transfer-with-examples-tofrom-laptop-box-google-drive-aws">Data transfer with examples to/from laptop, Box, Google Drive, AWS</h1>
<p>Let's see how we would transfer files/data to/from Savio using a few different approaches.</p>
<h1 id="data-transfer-scpsftp">Data transfer: SCP/SFTP</h1>
<p>We can use the <em>scp</em> and <em>sftp</em> protocols to transfer files.</p>
<p>You need to use the Savio data transfer node, <code>dtn.brc.berkeley.edu</code>.</p>
<p>Linux/Mac:</p>
<pre><code># to Savio, while on your local machine
scp bayArea.csv paciorek@dtn.brc.berkeley.edu:~/.
scp bayArea.csv paciorek@dtn.brc.berkeley.edu:~/data/newName.csv
scp bayArea.csv paciorek@dtn.brc.berkeley.edu:/global/scratch/paciorek/.

# from Savio, while on your local machine
scp paciorek@dtn.brc.berkeley.edu:~/data/newName.csv ~/Desktop/.</code></pre>
<p>If you can ssh to your local machine or want to transfer files to other systems on to which you can ssh, you can use the above syntax. The place you are copying from comes first and the place you are copying to comes second. For example,</p>
<pre><code>scp SAVIO_USERNAME@dtn.brc.berkeley.edu:~/file.csv \
    OTHER_USERNAME@other.domain.edu:~/data/.
scp OTHER_USERNAME@other.domain.edu:~/data/. \
    SAVIO_USERNAME@dtn.brc.berkeley.edu:~/file.csv </code></pre>
<p>One program you can use with Windows is WinSCP. After logging in, you'll see windows for the Savio filesystem and your local filesystem on your machine. You can drag files back and forth.</p>
<p>You can package multiple files (including directory structure) together using tar:</p>
<pre><code>tar -cvzf files.tgz dir_to_zip 
# to untar later:
tar -xvzf files.tgz</code></pre>
<h1 id="data-transfer-globus">Data transfer: Globus</h1>
<p>You can use Globus Connect to transfer data data to/from Savio (and between other resources) quickly and unattended. This is a better choice for large transfers.</p>
<p>For larger transfers and for making unattended transfers that will continue in the background, Globus Connect is a good option. Here are some <a href="http://research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/using-globus-connect-savio">instructions</a>.</p>
<p>Globus transfers data between <em>endpoints</em>. Possible endpoints include: Savio, your laptop or desktop, NERSC, and XSEDE, among others.</p>
<p>Savio's endpoint is named <code>ucb#brc</code>.</p>
<p>If you are transferring to/from your laptop, you'll need Globus Connect Personal set up and running on your machine and you'll need to establish your machine as an endpoint. At that point you can proceed as below.</p>
<p>To transfer files, you open Globus at <a href="https://globus.org">globus.org</a> and authenticate to the endpoints you want to transfer between. You can then start a transfer and it will proceed in the background, including restarting if interrupted.</p>
<p>Globus also provides a <a href="https://docs.globus.org/cli/using-the-cli">command line interface</a> that will allow you to do transfers programmatically, such that a transfer could be embedded in a workflow script.</p>
<h1 id="data-transfer-box">Data transfer: Box</h1>
<p>Box provides <strong>unlimited</strong>, free, secured, and encrypted content storage of files with a maximum file size of 15 Gb to Berkeley affiliates. So it's a good option for backup and long-term storage.</p>
<p>You can move files between Box and your laptop using the Box Sync app. And you can interact with Box via a web browser at <a href="http://box.berkeley.edu">http://box.berkeley.edu</a>.</p>
<p>The best way to move files between Box and Savio is <a href="http://research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/transferring-data-between-savio-and-your-uc-berkeley-box-account">via lftp as discussed here</a>.</p>
<p>Here's how you logon to box via <em>lftp</em> on Savio (assuming you've set up an external password already as described in the link above):</p>
<pre><code>ssh SAVIO_USERNAME@dtn.brc.berkeley.edu
lftp ftp.box.com
set ssl-allow true
user CAMPUS_USERNAME@berkeley.edu</code></pre>
<pre><code>lpwd # on Savio
ls # on box
!ls # on Savio
mkdir workshops
cd workshops # on box
lcd savio-training-intro-2016 # on savio
put foreach-doMPI.R # savio to box
get AirlineDataAll.ffData  # box to savio; 1.4 Gb in ~ 1 minute</code></pre>
<p>One additional command that can be quite useful is <em>mirror</em>, which lets you copy an entire directory to/from Box.</p>
<pre><code># to upload a directory from Savio to Box 
mirror -R mydir
# to download a directory from Box to Savio
mirror mydir .</code></pre>
<p>Be careful, because it's fairly easy to wipe out files or directories on Box.</p>
<p>Finally you can set up <em>special purpose accounts</em> (Berkeley SPA) so files are owned at a project level rather than by individuals.</p>
<p>BRC is working (long-term) on making Globus available for transfer to/from Box, but it's not available yet.</p>
<h1 id="data-transfer-bdrive-google-drive">Data transfer: bDrive (Google Drive)</h1>
<p>bDrive provides <strong>unlimited</strong>, free, secured, and encrypted content storage of files with a maximum file size of 5 Tb to Berkeley affiliates.</p>
<p>You can move files to and from your laptop using the Google Drive app.</p>
<p>There are also some third-party tools for copying files to/from Google Drive, though I've found them to be a bit klunky. This is why I'd recommend using Box for workflows at this point. However, BRC is also working (short-term) on making Globus available for transfer to/from bDrive, though it's not available yet.</p>
<h1 id="software-modules">Software modules</h1>
<p>A lot of software is available on Savio but needs to be loaded from the relevant software module before you can use it.</p>
<pre><code>module list  # what&#39;s loaded?
module avail  # what&#39;s available</code></pre>
<p>One thing that tricks people is that the modules are arranged in a hierarchical (nested) fashion, so you only see some of the modules as being available <em>after</em> you load the parent module. Here's how we see the Python packages that are available.</p>
<pre><code>which python
python

module avail
module load python/2.7.8
which python
module avail
module load numpy
python 
# import numpy as np</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, we can see that linear algebra, FFT, and HDF5/NetCDF software is available only after loading either the intel or gcc modules.</p>
<pre><code>module load intel
module avail</code></pre>
<h1 id="submitting-jobs-accounts-and-partitions">Submitting jobs: accounts and partitions</h1>
<p>All computations are done by submitting jobs to the scheduling software that manages jobs on the cluster, called SLURM.</p>
<p>When submitting a job, the main things you need to indicate are the project account you are using (in some cases you might have access to multiple accounts such as an FCA and a condo) and the partition.</p>
<p>You can see what accounts you have access to and which partitions within those accounts as follows:</p>
<pre><code>sacctmgr -p show associations user=USERNAME</code></pre>
<p>If you are part of a condo, you'll notice that you have <em>low-priority</em> access to certain partitions. For example I am part of the statistics cluster <em>co_stat</em>, which owns some Savio2 nodes and therefore I have normal access to those, but I can also burst beyond the condo and use other partitions at low-priority (see below).</p>
<p>In contrast, through my FCA, I have access to the savio, savio2, and big memory partitions.</p>
<h1 id="submitting-a-batch-job">Submitting a batch job</h1>
<p>Let's see how to submit a simple job. If your job will only use the resources on a single node, you can do the following.</p>
<p>Here's an example job script that I'll run. You'll need to modify the --account value and possibly the --partition value.</p>
<pre><code>    #!/bin/bash
    # Job name:
    #SBATCH --job-name=test
    #
    # Account:
    #SBATCH --account=co_stat
    #
    # Partition:
    #SBATCH --partition=savio2
    #
    # Wall clock limit:
    #SBATCH --time=00:00:30
    #
    ## Command(s) to run:
    module load python/3.2.3 numpy
    python3 calc.py &gt;&amp; calc.out</code></pre>
<p>Now let's submit and monitor the job:</p>
<pre><code>sbatch job.sh

squeue -j $YOUR_JOB_ID

wwall -j $YOUR_JOB_ID</code></pre>
<p>Note that except for the <em>savio2_htc</em> and <em>savio2_gpu</em> partitions, all jobs are given exclusive access to the entire node or nodes assigned to the job (and your account is charged for all of the cores on the node(s).</p>
<h1 id="parallel-job-submission">Parallel job submission</h1>
<p>If you are submitting a job that uses multiple nodes, you'll need to carefully specify the resources you need. The key flags for use in your job script are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--nodes</code> (or <code>-N</code>): indicates the number of nodes to use</li>
<li><code>--ntasks-per-node</code>: indicates the number of tasks (i.e., processes) one wants to run on each node</li>
<li><code>--cpus-per-task</code> (or <code>-c</code>): indicates the number of cpus to be used for each task</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, in some cases it can make sense to use the <code>--ntasks</code> (or <code>-n</code>) option to indicate the total number of tasks and let the scheduler determine how many nodes and tasks per node are needed. In general <code>--cpus-per-task</code> will be 1 except when running threaded code.</p>
<p>Here's an example job script for a job that uses MPI for parallelizing over multiple nodes:</p>
<pre><code>   #!/bin/bash
   # Job name:
   #SBATCH --job-name=test
   #
   # Account:
   #SBATCH --account=account_name
   #
   # Partition:
   #SBATCH --partition=partition_name
   #
   # Number of MPI tasks needed for use case (example):
   #SBATCH --ntasks=40
   #
   # Processors per task:
   #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
   #
   # Wall clock limit:
   #SBATCH --time=00:00:30
   #
   ## Command(s) to run (example):
   module load openmpi
   mpirun ./a.out</code></pre>
<p>When you write your code, you may need to specify information about the number of cores to use. SLURM will provide a variety of variables that you can use in your code so that it adapts to the resources you have requested rather than being hard-coded.</p>
<p>Here are some of the variables that may be useful: SLURM_NTASKS, SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK, SLURM_NODELIST, SLURM_NNODES.</p>
<p>There are lots more examples of job submission scripts for different kinds of parallelization (multi-node (MPI), multi-core (openMP), hybrid, etc.) <a href="http://research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/running-your-jobs#Job-submission-with-specific-resource-requirements">here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="interactive-jobs">Interactive jobs</h1>
<p>You can also do work interactively.</p>
<p>For this, you may want to have used the -X flag to ssh if you are running software with a GUI such as MATLAB.</p>
<pre><code># ssh -X USERNAME@hpc.brc.berkeley.edu
srun -A co_stat -p savio2  -N 1 -t 10:0 --pty bash
matlab</code></pre>
<h1 id="low-priority-queue">Low-priority queue</h1>
<p>Condo users have access to the broader compute resource that is limited only by the size of partitions, under the savio_lowprio QoS (queue). However this QoS does not get a priority as high as the general QoSs, such as &quot;savio_normal&quot; and &quot;savio_debug&quot;, or all the condo QoSs, and it is subject to preemption when all the other QoSs become busy.</p>
<p>More details can be found <a href="http://research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/user-guide">in the <em>Low Priority Jobs</em> section</a>.</p>
<p>Suppose I wanted to burst beyond the Statistics condo to run on 20 nodes. I'll illustrate here with an interactive job though usually this would be for a batch job.</p>
<pre><code>srun -A co_stat -p savio2 --qos=savio_lowprio  -N 20 -t 10:0 --pty bash
env | grep SLURM</code></pre>
<h1 id="htc-jobs">HTC jobs</h1>
<p>There is a partition called the HTC partition that allows you to request cores individually rather than an entire node at a time. The nodes in this partition are faster than the other nodes and have access to flash storage for fast I/O.</p>
<p>You must request access to the HTC partition at this time before you can submit jobs to it.</p>
<pre><code>srun -A co_stat -p savio2_htc  -n 2 -t 10:0 --pty bash
env | grep SLURM
python3 calc.py &gt;&amp; calc.out &amp;
top</code></pre>
<p>??? details on accessing flash storage for I/O?</p>
<h1 id="monitoring-jobs-and-the-job-queue">Monitoring jobs and the job queue</h1>
<p>The basic command for seeing what is running on the system is <code>squeue</code>:</p>
<pre><code>squeue
squeue -u USERNAME
squeue -a co_stat</code></pre>
<p>To see what nodes are available in a given partition:</p>
<pre><code>sinfo -p savio
sinfo -p savio2_gpu</code></pre>
<p>You can cancel a job with <code>scancel</code>.</p>
<pre><code>scancel $YOUR_JOB_ID</code></pre>
<p>For more information on cores, QoS, and additional (e.g., GPU) resources, here's some syntax:</p>
<pre><code>squeue -o &quot;%.7i %.9P %.20j %.8u %.2t %.9M %.5C %.8r %.6D %R %p %q %b&quot; </code></pre>
<p>We provide some <a href="http://research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/tips-using-brc-savio-cluster">tips about monitoring your job</a>.</p>
